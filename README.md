Hi, I’m @gothick. I'm a random geek from Bristol, England. I've been programming for about forty
years. I'm very much a jack-of-all-trades style generalist, often picking up a technology, doing 
some odd project in it, then moving on to something completely different.

As a day job I'm a management information developer mostly on the Microsoft SQL Server platform; in
my spare time I'm now developing for Android or iOS or using (modern, usually Symfony-based)
PHP on the web, sometimes adding JavaScript in whatever framework happens to be popular that 
Tuesday.

Along the way I've gotten good enough to hold down paid jobs using C, C++, C#, Visual Basic, PHP, 
JavaScript, Java, Objective C, Oracle PL/SQL, XSL, Python, SSIS, SSAS, Informatica ETL, and 
probably a few more things I've forgotten. I've basically become That Guy Who Knows A Bit About
Everything, which I've found to be a pretty useful role, especially on smaller, fast-moving teams.
