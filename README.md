Hi, I’m @gothick. I'm a random geek from Bristol, England. I've been programming for about forty
years. I'm very much a jack-of-all-trades style generalist, often picking up a technology, doing 
some odd project in it, then moving on to something completely different.

As a day job I'm a management information developer mostly on the Microsoft SQL Server platform; in
my spare time I'm generally developing for Android or iOS or using (modern, usually Symfony-based)
PHP on the web, sometimes adding JavaScript in whatever framework happens to be popular that 
Tuesday.
